Broken Water Points
===================

Using mobile phones to help monitor broken water points is a common use case for ICT in development.

In this example, we'll show you how bamboo with a mobile reporting platform like formhub could be used to help you monitor the functionality of water points.

Create the Water Point Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, let's create a very simple water report form using an XLSForm consisting of the following fields:

* **submit_date** - Date the water point was checked
* **wp_id** - Water point id
* **functional** - A boolean (yes/no) is the water point functional

Note: Please avoid naming any fields "date" or bamboo will mistake it with an internal date function.

Next, download `water_point_report.xls <http://formhub.org/mberg/forms/water_point_report/form.xls>`_ which is an XLSForm [#]_ representation of the form above and publish it to your `formhub <http://formhub.org>`_ account.  This will allow you to begin collecting data using this form via ODK Collect on your mobile or via a web-form.

Once you've published your form to formhub, you  click on the `webform link <http://pmywi.enketo.formhub.org/webform>`_ for **water_point_report** and enter some sample data.  Your webform should look like this.

For this example, let's imagine we have four water points labeled A-D.  Pick a date (say Jan 1st, 2013) and submit a report for each water point indicating whether it's functional or not.  Once you've done this, go back to your formhub account and you should see **4** submissions for the **water_point_report**.

Linking to bamboo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

formhub provides some powerful ways to vizualize data but to generate dynamic indicators and for more advanced data analytics you will want to use `bamboo <http://bamboo.io>`_.

1. Goto the water_point_report form page and under bamboo click the **Activate** button.
